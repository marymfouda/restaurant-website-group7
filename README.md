# Git & GitHub 

Welcome! If you are looking to master the art of version control and collaboration, you are in the right place. This is a simple, hands-on project designed to help beginners practice the core Git workflow.

## Project Goals
The main objective is to understand how developers work together using:
* **Branching:** Working on features without breaking the main code.
* **Pull Requests (PR):** Suggesting changes for review.
* **Merging:** Integrating new updates into the final project.

## Core Concepts

### 1. What is Git & GitHub?
* **Git:** A version control system that tracks every change you make to your files.
* **GitHub:** A cloud-based platform where we host Git repositories to collaborate with others.

### 2. Pull Request (PR)
A PR is a way to notify others that you've completed a feature or fixed a bug. It allows the team to review your code before it becomes part of the main project.

### 3. Merging
Merging is the process of taking the history and changes from one branch and joining them into another (usually the `main` branch).
